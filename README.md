# /Sum/:
__Stasis__ is a highly experimental virtual machine project, inspired by _CIL_ and _Forth_ languages.  
It was designed embeddable and easily extensible, though not really meant for scripting atm.  
❗ There are no documentation provided yet, so some reverse-engineering skills is crucial ❗ 

# /Featuræ/:
* 2bytecode-based extensible instruction set with most x86 operations (including FPU) covered.
* Forth-esque assembly language compiler with some ideas burrowed from [Rebol](http://www.rebol.com/).
* Classical case-insensetive syntax.
* Extensive namesapce support.
