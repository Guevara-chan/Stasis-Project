# /Sum/:
__Stasis__ is a highly experimental virtual machine project, inspired by _CIL_ and _Forth_ languages.  
It was designed embeddable and easily extensible, though not really meant for scripting atm.  
❗ There are no documentation provided yet, so some reverse-engineering skills is crucial ❗ 

# /Featuræ/:
* 2bytecode-based extensible instruction set with most x86 operations (including FPU) covered.
* Lightweight (~100Kb) interpeter with basic string and OS microlibraries included.
* Forth-esque assembly language compiler with some ideas burrowed from [Rebol](http://www.rebol.com/).
* Basic compile-time calculations support.
* Forward subroutine referencing support.
* Classical case-insensetive syntax.
* Extensive namespace support.
